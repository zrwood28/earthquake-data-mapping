# leaflet-challenge
Mapping earthquake locations and magnitudes in the United States.

#### Summary
Recent earthquake data was called from the USGS website as a GeoJSON. The webpage was formatted and stylized using html and css. The map and layers were created using
the Leaflet library. Javascript code populated each marker that represents a recent instance of an earthquake. Upon clicking each circle marker, the user is able to 
see a popup that includes some information about that specific earthquake. Each circle marker's size is representative of magnitude and the color stands for the earthquake's depth. A legend was also included in the bottom right to provide greater reference to the earthquake's depth.
